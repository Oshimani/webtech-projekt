# Webtech Projekt

This is my projects for web frameworks cours.
It consists mainly out of 3 controllers.
One for the home page, one for poems and one for authors.

Poems and authors can be uploaded, viewed, edited and deleted.
Poems and authors have a one to many relation.
Poems can be praised. There is no limitation to how often a user can praise a single poem.

## Hint
Please use the provided database in **/var/data.db**. It should make viewing features like 'best authors' and the praise system easier.

## How to install and serve
```bash
composer install
symfony serve
```

## Available Routes:
